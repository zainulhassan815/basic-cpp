/*
To make a profit, a local store marks up the prices of its items by a certain percentage. Write a C++
program that reads the original price of the item sold, the percentage of the marked-up price, and the
sales tax rate. The program then outputs the original price of the item, the percentage of the mark-up,
the storeâ€™s selling price of the item, the sales tax, and the final price of the item. (The final price of the item is the selling price plus the sales tax.)
