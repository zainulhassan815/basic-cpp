/*
Suppose you give a dinner party for six guests, but your table seats only four. In how many ways
can four of the six guests arrange themselves at the table? Any of the six guests can sit in the first
chair. Any of the remaining five can sit in the second chair. Any of the remaining four can sit in
the third chair, and any of the remaining three can sit in the fourth chair. (The last two will have to
stand.) So, the number of possible arrangements of six guests in four chairs is 6*5*4*3, which is
360. Write a program that calculates the number of possible arrangements for any number of guests
and any number of chairs. (Assume there will never be fewer guests than chairs.) Donâ€™t let this get
too complicated. A simple for loop should do it.
